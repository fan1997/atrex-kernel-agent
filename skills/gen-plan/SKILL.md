# Generate Plan

This repository-native skill is adapted from the `gen-plan` flow in PolyArch Humanize. It turns an
episode draft into a complete implementation plan without modifying source code or starting the
implementation.

## Arguments

- `--input <path>`: required draft document.
- `--output <path>`: required new plan document.
- `--direct`: generate a one-shot plan without asking questions.
- `--discussion`: ask for decisions that materially change the plan. This is the default when no
  mode is supplied.

`--direct` and `--discussion` are mutually exclusive.

## Hard boundaries

- During this workflow, persist only the requested plan file. Consultation helpers may use
  automatically removed process scratch for isolation.
- Do not edit source, run implementation tasks, create commits, or start another workflow.
- The `ask_codex` and `ask_qoder` consultations are read-only and non-persistent. Give both the
  same bounded evidence packet, isolate Codex from the project, and disable Qoder tools.
- Preserve every requirement, constraint, measurement, search result, and rejected direction from
  the draft. The structured plan must be a superset of the draft.
- Keep the original draft verbatim at the bottom of the plan between the template markers.

## Workflow

Execute these phases sequentially.

### 1. Validate input and output

From the campaign workspace, run:

```bash
bash skills/gen-plan/scripts/validate-gen-plan-io.sh \
  --input <input> --output <output> <mode>
```

Stop on a nonzero exit. The script reports the resolved input, output, template, and mode. It never
creates the output file.

### 2. Check relevance

Read the draft and quickly inspect the workspace README, goal, current kernel, prior memory, and any
paths named by the draft. Reject only a draft that is clearly unrelated to this repository. Be
lenient with informal drafts and mixed languages.

### 3. Analyze the draft

Build an evidence-to-action chain:

1. Identify the measured bottleneck or failure.
2. Connect the evidence to a concrete inference.
3. Select exactly one coherent optimization category for the plan.
4. Identify the smallest concrete file changes that test that inference.
5. Define correctness, performance, rollback, and stop conditions.

Check the draft for unclear scope, contradictions, missing dependencies, infeasible changes, and
quantitative targets. Treat numeric performance targets as trends unless the draft explicitly marks
them as hard acceptance thresholds.

In `direct` mode, make conservative assumptions and record unresolved material choices under
`Pending Decisions`; do not pause for questions. In `discussion` mode, ask only questions whose
answers materially change scope, correctness, or acceptance.

### 4. Obtain independent Codex and Qoder reviews

The campaign probes both optional reviewers once before the first optimization episode and caches
the decision in its private runtime state. A reviewer disabled by that startup probe must not be
retried by later plans in the same campaign; retain the helper's
`disabled_after_startup_probe` status and recorded reason. Campaign restarts reuse the same cached
decision.

After completing the initial analysis, freeze one evidence packet and use the bundled dual-review
helper before choosing the final plan direction. Give both reviewers the original draft plus the
same small set of directly relevant text files, normally `README.md`, `kernel.py`, the latest
canonical memory entry, and source or profile summaries cited by the draft. Never include
credentials, raw secrets, unrelated files, or large binary profile artifacts.

```bash
bash skills/gen-plan/scripts/ask-reviewers.sh \
  --input <input> \
  --context README.md \
  --context kernel.py
```

Add other `--context` arguments only when they materially affect the plan. The helper starts the
applicable external reviewers concurrently so neither can see or anchor on the other's response.
Both external reviewer processes default to maximum reasoning effort; episode/session settings and
legacy `--reasoning-effort` arguments cannot lower it. A campaign may explicitly pin Codex with
`ATREX_ASK_CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT` to `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`; Qoder remains
fixed at `max`.
By default each external review is ephemeral. `--long-reviewer-session codex` resumes one
campaign-private, read-only Codex thread across episodes while continuing to send the complete
current draft and bounded context on every call. Long Qoder and Claude reviewer sessions are not
implemented and fail explicitly. Session state lives under `.atrex_long_horizon/` and must never
enter a candidate commit.
Each review returns its backend-specific summary marker followed by the same five assessment
sections:

- `CODEX_SUMMARY` or `QODER_SUMMARY`
- `RISKS`
- `MISSING_REQUIREMENTS`
- `DIRECTION_RECOMMENDATIONS`
- `VALIDATION_RECOMMENDATIONS`
- `QUESTIONS_OR_ASSUMPTIONS`

If the current episode backend is Codex or Qoder, first complete and retain that backend's review in
the current session using the same sections. Only then run the helper; it skips the matching nested
process and obtains the other backend's independent review. Mark the retained review status
`current_codex_session` or `current_qoder_session`. Do not revise it after seeing the external review;
resolve new information only during synthesis. Claude and Pi backends use both external reviewers.

If either reviewer is unavailable, times out, or fails, do not fabricate its advice. In `direct`
mode, continue with the available review and conservative analysis, recording each status and
failure reason. If both fail, continue using only the primary analysis and label the result as
unreviewed. In `discussion` mode, ask whether to retry or continue with partial or no independent
review.

### 5. Synthesize both reviews and generate the plan

Compare the Codex and Qoder reviews only after both have completed. Treat agreement as a useful
confidence signal, not proof, and resolve disagreement from the original draft and repository
evidence rather than by majority vote. Evaluate every recommendation as follows:

1. Adopt a suggestion only when it strengthens the selected evidence-to-action chain, closes a
   correctness gap, or makes validation more deterministic.
2. Reject suggestions that contradict measured evidence, violate campaign constraints, or introduce
   another optimization category.
3. Defer suggestions that are plausible but need evidence outside the current direction.
4. Resolve conflicting suggestions explicitly, stating the evidence that selected one or rejected
   both.
5. Convert unresolved reviewer questions into conservative assumptions or pending decisions
   according to the selected direct/discussion mode.

Both reviewers are advisory, not authoritative. The final plan must remain a superset of the human
draft and must still contain exactly one optimization category.

Use `skills/gen-plan/templates/gen-plan-template.md` as the output schema. Replace every placeholder
with concrete content. The plan must include:

- the goal and the profile/research evidence that motivates it;
- Codex and Qoder consultation status, their material findings, agreements, disagreements, and the
  suggestions adopted, rejected, or deferred with reasons;
- exactly one optimization category and its evidence-to-inference-to-action chain;
- acceptance criteria in `AC-N` form, each with positive and negative tests;
- upper and lower scope boundaries plus allowed and prohibited choices;
- exact target paths and a dependency-ordered implementation sequence;
- full-workload correctness, multi-seed correctness, and comparable performance validation;
- measurable success, rollback, and direction-exhaustion conditions;
- any assumptions or pending decisions; and
- the original draft, unchanged, at the bottom.

Use milestones, phases, and steps rather than time estimates. Refer to code by path and symbol, not
by line range. Plan terminology such as `AC-N`, `Milestone`, and `Phase` belongs in the plan only and
must not be prescribed as implementation naming.

### 6. Review and write

Before writing, verify that the plan:

- does not omit or contradict the draft;
- uses both reviews selectively and records the disposition of material suggestions and conflicts;
- proposes only one attributable optimization category;
- names concrete files and validation commands;
- distinguishes correctness from performance evidence;
- has deterministic, measurable acceptance and rollback conditions; and
- contains no implementation changes made during planning.

Write the complete plan to the validated output path, then read it back and fix any remaining
placeholder, inconsistency, or missing draft content. Report the output path, optimization category,
both consultation statuses, adopted-suggestion count, acceptance-criteria count, and pending-decision
count.

## Validation exit codes

| Exit code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Validation passed |
| 1 | Input file not found |
| 2 | Input file is empty |
| 3 | Output directory does not exist |
| 4 | Output path already exists |
| 5 | Output directory is not writable |
| 6 | Invalid arguments |
| 7 | Plan template is missing |

## Reviewer consultation exit codes

| Exit code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Consultation completed, or nested invocation intentionally skipped for the matching backend |
| 1 | Draft or context input is invalid |
| 2 | Helper arguments or environment configuration are invalid |
| 3 | Reviewer response is missing one or more required review sections |
| 124 | Reviewer consultation timed out |
| 127 | Reviewer CLI could not be found or started |

`ask-reviewers.sh` reports the exit status of each child consultation in its structured output and
returns successfully once both attempts finish, allowing direct mode to retain a surviving review.
